Look-at
  Using the look-at method, I move the viewer to the bottom-left side of the object.
  Upon moving the viewer it was revealed that the object is a Moai statue.

Projections
  The orthographic and perspective projections can be toggled by using 'o' and 'p'.
  The projections were implemented using the formulas described in the class slides.

The lights
  I implemented a point light source and a directional light and the shading used is Phong shading.
  The point light source is positioned to the top right of the object and
  has intensity and reflectance coefficients.

      Ia = vec3(0.5, 0.8, 0.5);
      Id = vec3(0.4, 0.8, 0.3);
      Is = vec3(1.0, 1.0, 1.0);

      ka = vec3(0.5, 0.5, 0.6);
      kd = vec3(0.8, 0.6, 0.6);
      ks = vec3(1.0, 1.0, 1.0);

  The directional light is located behind the viewer and only has a diffuse component.

      lightDirection = vec3(0.0, 0.0, -1.0);
      directionColor = vec3(0.5, 0.7, 0.7);

  The decision to have only a diffuse component has been permitted and saves variable
  count and the number of times the GPU needs to be accessed. Both of the lights were
  programmed similar to the examples on the slides.

The Toggles
  Both of the lights can be toggled using buttons on the page.
  The specular reflection for the point light source can be toggled
  using a button on the page. I decided to make it so you can turn
  the specular light on when the rest of the point light is off.
